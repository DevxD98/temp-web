Assuming we have a table named students with columns like student_id, first_name, last_name, age, and grade, here's an example of using predicates in a SELECT query:

-- Example 1: Equality Predicate
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade = 'A';

-- Example 2: Range Predicate (Greater Than)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;

-- Example 3: LIKE Predicate (Pattern Matching)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE last_name LIKE 'Smith%';

-- Example 4: IS NULL Predicate
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade IS NULL;
